## scottmangiapane.com

My personal website and project portfolio. I made it entirely from scratch, without any libraries or dependencies.

## Versions

I like to completely redo my website from time to time, so look [here] (https://github.com/scottmangiapane/scottmangiapane.com/branches) if you want to see earlier versions.
